# TinToken (TIN) - ERC20 Token Contract

## Overview
TinToken (TIN) is an ERC20 token contract implemented in Solidity. It provides a standard ERC20 token interface with additional features such as minting, burning, and ownership control.

## Features
- **Standard ERC20 Interface**: TinToken implements the standard ERC20 token interface, allowing it to be compatible with existing wallets, exchanges, and smart contracts.
- **Minting**: The contract owner can mint new tokens to a specified address using the `mint` function.
- **Burning**: Token holders can burn their own tokens using the `burn` function.
- **Ownership Control**: Certain functions are restricted to the contract owner using the `onlyOwner` modifier, ensuring that critical operations are executed only by authorized parties.

## Getting Started
To deploy TinToken to the Ethereum blockchain, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd <repository_name>`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Compile the smart contracts: `npx hardhat compile`
5. Deploy the contract to a testnet or mainnet using Hardhat or any other Ethereum development framework.

## Usage
Once deployed, TinToken can be interacted with using Ethereum wallets, dApps, or other smart contracts. Here are some common operations:

- **Transfer Tokens**: Use the `transfer` function to transfer tokens from one address to another.
- **Mint Tokens**: If you're the owner, use the `mint` function to mint new tokens to a specified address.
- **Burn Tokens**: Any token holder can burn their own tokens using the `burn` function.

## Example
Here's an example of how to deploy and interact with TinToken using Hardhat:

```javascript
// Deploy TinToken
const TinToken = await ethers.getContractFactory("TinToken");
const tinToken = await TinToken.deploy("TinToken", "TIN", initialSupply);

// Mint Tokens
await tinToken.mint(walletAddress, amountToMint);

// Transfer Tokens
await tinToken.transfer(recipientAddress, amountToSend);

// Burn Tokens
await tinToken.connect(burner).burn(amountToBurn);
```
